# OpenSpec Instructions

These instructions are for AI assistants working in this project.

## Project Quick Stats

- **1,899 extractors** with 100% high-confidence metadata
- SQLite-backed library with FTS5 search
- Textual TUI with modern vintage aesthetic

Always open `@/openspec/AGENTS.md` when the request:

- Mentions planning or proposals (words like proposal, spec, change, plan)
- Introduces new capabilities, breaking changes, architecture shifts
- Sounds ambiguous and you need the authoritative spec before coding

Use `@/openspec/AGENTS.md` to learn:

- How to create and apply change proposals
- Spec format and conventions
- Project structure and guidelines
- Registry schema and enrichment pipeline

Keep this managed block so 'openspec update' can refresh the instructions.
